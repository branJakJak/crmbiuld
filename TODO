also this part is so hard to explain about the agents i dont know where to start ouch

Leighton Power New No. 3-25-2017, [15.08.17 02:11]
ok i will try,   the people that doing the leads should be able to log into the crm and see only their leads,  veiw only permissions,  BUT are able to move some pictures into pending apprisal images they select  into  traige,  and be able to create document themselfs  so that then legal can check this case

Leighton Power New No. 3-25-2017, [15.08.17 02:12]
because also should have said this before that,  but there are 2 types of images,  ID docs, and  then the pictures ,  they should be auto go into the correct sections.

i am also getting error 500 on the leads so it was hard to talke about this with him
